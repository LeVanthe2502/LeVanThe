Problem:
Modify the program of Project 4 to compute the area of a triangle. Issue the
appropriate prompts for the triangleâ€™s base and height, and change the names of
the variables appropriately. Then, use the formula .5 * base * height
to compute the area. Test the program from an IDLE window.
Solution:

    ....
"""
Base=int(input("Enter with base:"))
Height=int(input("Enter with height:"))
CT=5*Base*Height
print("The area is",CT,"square units")
