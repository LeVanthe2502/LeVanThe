Problem:
What role do translators play in the programming process?

Solution:
Role of translators:
• The translators are used to convert high level language known as program code or source code into executable code.
• Translators also check for syntax errors before converting the high-level language into exécutable code.If any error
  is found by the translator, then it returns the error message to the programmer.
•If no error is found by the translator, then it returns the converted executable code.
