Problem:
    Describe an instruction that is not well defined and thus could not be included as a
step in an algorithm. Give an example of such an instruction.

Solution:
The process that cannot be carried out by any computing agent should not be included as a step in an algorithm.
The statement of 'Dividing a number by zero' is not well defined as division by zero cannot be performed by the
processor and if not handled correctly then it would crash the program
