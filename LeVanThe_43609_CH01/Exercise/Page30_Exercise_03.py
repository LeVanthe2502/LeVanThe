Problem:
    Why does Python code generate fewer types of syntax errors than code in other
programming languages?
Solution:
Python code generates fewer types of syntax error than code in any other programming language because of the following reasons:
• Python has simple syntax rules whereas other languages have strict syntax formats for functions, variable declaration
 and definition, class definition etc.
 • Python keeps track of indentation which is not used by other programming languages but other languages
 use other syntax like square brackets and curly-braces for representing a block of code.
 • Less syntax rules in python results in use of less number of symbols and thus decrease the chances of syntax errors
