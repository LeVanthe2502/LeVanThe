Problem:
    Jack says that he will not bother with analysis and design but proceed directly to
coding his programs. Why is that not a good idea?
Solution:
If Jack ignored the design and analysis process, he wouldn't be able to understand
the underlying functional process of the problem. Understanding the problem
before actual implementation is necessary to create a prototype of the program,
otherwise the programmer may lose track.
